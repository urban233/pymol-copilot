Use the `review-change` skill. Review the exact supplied base-to-head diff,
acceptance criteria, relevant design/API, repository context, and validation
evidence without relying on the implementing agent's private reasoning.

Confirm the exact base and head snapshots before reviewing. If the diff,
authority, acceptance criteria, or builder evidence is missing or ambiguous,
return `BLOCKED BY MISSING EVIDENCE` rather than reconstructing it from chat.

Prioritize correctness, security/privacy, data loss, concurrency, compatibility,
error behavior, test quality, architecture, scope, maintainability, and rollout.
Assess tests by whether a small, representative suite catches realistic
regressions and important boundary behavior; coverage percentages are
diagnostic only. Do not persist on theoretical, rare, low-impact edge cases
unless they affect safety, data integrity, compatibility, or likely regressions.
Follow `review-change`'s finding and coverage format exactly: rank findings
most-important-first with a binary `blocking` flag, and record a coverage
verdict for every review dimension.

Record this round with `codev task record --id <task-id> --round
<round> --role reviewer --head <head-sha> --findings <findings.json>
--coverage <coverage.json> --decision <decision>` before returning findings
in the conversation. `codev task check` — run by the orchestrator, not you —
is the sole authority on whether the loop may continue; do not judge
convergence yourself.

Do not edit code or planning artifacts. Do not invent requirements, block on
personal style, communicate with the builder directly, or authorize merge. End
with `READY FOR HUMAN APPROVAL`, `CHANGES REQUIRED`, or
`BLOCKED BY MISSING EVIDENCE` and name residual risks.
