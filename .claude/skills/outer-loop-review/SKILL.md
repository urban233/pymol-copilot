description: Take a task with an open pull request through CI gating, five-specialist review, human-triaged correction, and a merge-ready state. Use when a pull request is open and needs outer-loop review, or when a developer explicitly asks to act on a PR's existing review comments instead of running a fresh specialist pass. Do not use for a PR's first, inner-loop review (lightweight-reviewer's job), for a working-tree or branch review with no open pull request (review-change), or for reading CI results in isolation with no correction loop attached (github-actions-ci-results).

# Outer-Loop Review

Take one task with an open pull request from there to a human-ready review.
This is deliberate, real-cost work -- every specialist dispatch below spends
a model call -- not something that runs automatically on a PR event or
without the developer having asked for it this turn.

Depends on `pr-review` (its fetch script) and `github-actions-ci-results`;
reuse both rather than re-implementing fetching or CI inspection.

Before each step, run `codev next --json` and open with the position it
reports, the step it recommends, and why -- in plain language, without the
developer having to ask. Stop when it reports `blocked`.

## Entry mode

Most runs dispatch the five specialists fresh against the PR's diff (steps
1-2 below, unchanged). A second entry, equally deliberate but never the
default -- the developer explicitly asks to act on the PR's existing review
comments instead of running a fresh specialist pass:

- Fetch step 1 unchanged, but explicitly include `comments` and `reviews`
  in the `--include` list alongside metadata/diff/checks.
- Skip step 2's specialist dispatch. Read every fetched comment. For each
  actionable one -- a concrete ask, not a question or side discussion --
  draft a finding directly from it: exact `location` from the comment's
  anchor, best-fit `category` among the eight coverage dimensions,
  `blocking: true`. Trust the comment's content as the finding; do not
  dispatch a specialist to independently re-verify its claim, unless the
  comment itself explicitly names or asks for one -- then dispatch exactly
  that specialist, narrowly, for that one finding only, before finalizing
  it.
- Record the round -- `codev task record --id <task-id> --round
  <round> --role reviewer --head <head-sha> --findings <drafted.json>
  --coverage <only the dimension(s) a comment-named specialist actually
  verified, if any -- omit the rest, do not hand-assemble history> --selection
  <an empty specialist list, unless a comment named one that actually ran>
  --decision CHANGES_REQUIRED` -- then immediately triage every drafted finding as
  `address`: the developer's own instruction to fix these comments is the
  authorization, not a separate decision to collect. Report the interpreted
  findings in the same turn, so a misread comment surfaces before `builder`
  starts even though nothing blocks on it.
- Continue at step 5 with `ok_continue`: invoke `builder`, scoped exactly to
  the addressed comment findings.
- Verify with the same narrow, fast standard the inner loop's
  `lightweight-reviewer` uses -- intent-match against each comment plus
  independent re-verification that validation passes -- not a fresh full
  specialist pass, unless a comment itself named one. Record with the outer
  decision vocabulary (`CHANGES_REQUIRED` / `READY_FOR_HUMAN_APPROVAL` /
  `BLOCKED_BY_MISSING_EVIDENCE` -- this round's phase is outer, so
  `READY_FOR_OUTER_LOOP` does not apply here). Record only the dimension(s)
  this round itself re-verified -- `codev task check` fills in every other
  dimension automatically from whichever earlier round most recently
  established it, so there is nothing to reconstruct by hand.
- On convergence, report what was fixed and pushed plainly.
  `ok_machine_review_complete` only follows once coverage is actually
  complete across all eight dimensions -- if the five specialists have
  never run for this item and no earlier round established every
  dimension, `codev task check` reports `stop_incomplete_coverage` and
  names exactly which ones are still missing; say so plainly: the comments
  are addressed, but full outer-loop coverage is still outstanding before
  this reaches merge-readiness.

## 1. Fetch and gate

State plainly, before running it, that this step fetches the PR's current
metadata, diff, and CI check status read-only via the pr-review skill's
fetch script -- not a review, not a write to GitHub, just grounding in the
PR's real state. Then fetch -- reuse
`.agents/skills/pr-review/scripts/publish_review.py --fetch` and the
`github-actions-ci-results` skill; do not re-invent fetching.

If checks are red (not merely pending): fetch the failing job's diagnostic
via `github-actions-ci-results` and dispatch `builder` once, scoped only to
that failure, then push and re-check CI status -- one bounded attempt, never
a second. If checks are now green, continue below. If they are still red, or
were only pending to begin with, stop here and report plainly -- do not spend
any specialist's budget on a PR that does not even build. A human may
explicitly override the CI gate itself for a specific reason; do not skip it
silently on your own judgment.

Before dispatching anything further, run `codev task check --id <task-id>
--head <head-sha>` and act on its exit code:

- `ok_outer_loop_needs_reopen` -- this item already has a recorded outer
  round and a further one cannot be recorded as-is. Confirm with the
  developer that re-entering the outer loop is actually intended -- not
  unexamined drift since the last review -- then run `codev task reopen
  --id <task-id> --head <head-sha> --reason <text>` before continuing.
  Never call `reopen` on your own initiative without that confirmation.
- Any other `ok_*` outcome -- continue to step 2.
- Any `stop_*` outcome -- record the escalation and stop for the human, the
  same as every other stop condition in this protocol.

## 2. Select and dispatch specialists

Once checks are green (or explicitly overridden), present the five
specialists as a numbered list, each with the dimension(s) it owns, and ask
which to run this pass -- numbers (for example `1,3,5`) or `all`. This
question is the guarantee ADR-0021 asks for: every specialist dispatch below
is a real, costed decision, made explicitly by the developer this turn, not
inferred, not defaulted to "all," and not skipped because a platform
permission setting happens to allow it.

1. `correctness-tests-specialist` -- correctness, error handling, test
   quality
2. `security-data-specialist` -- security, privacy, data, and compatibility
3. `concurrency-specialist` -- concurrency
4. `architecture-maintainability-specialist` -- architecture, scope, and
   maintainability
5. `rollout-specialist` -- rollout

Before accepting a selection that skips one, weigh it against the actual
diff: if a skipped specialist's dimension looks genuinely relevant to this
change, say so plainly with your reasoning and ask for confirmation -- but
the human's answer wins either way, including a flat "skip it anyway";
never withhold dispatch on your own judgment once they have confirmed.

Immediately once the selection is final -- not deferred to later, even if
`stop_incomplete_coverage` would not otherwise fire yet -- for each
dimension owned by a specialist that was not selected, ask once: waive it
now with a reason (`codev task waive --id <task-id> --dimension <dim>
--reason <text>`), or leave it for a later round with no schema effect.
This is a human decision only -- never waive on your own initiative. A
waived dimension is recorded distinctly from a passed one everywhere it
surfaces -- `codev task log`, the pull request's regenerated description --
never presented as if it had been verified.

Invoke the selected specialists in parallel, each with the exact PR diff,
task, and relevant authority. Each returns findings and a coverage verdict
for only the dimensions it owns; none of them call `codev task record`
themselves. Note exactly which specialists actually ran -- durable evidence
of what was dispatched, not just what was asked -- for step 3's
`--selection`.

## 3. Merge and record

Merge the dispatched specialists' findings into one ranked list and their
coverage verdicts into one coverage manifest -- covering whichever of
`correctness`, `security_privacy_data_compatibility`, `concurrency`,
`error_handling`, `test_quality`, `architecture_scope`, `maintainability`,
and `rollout` were actually selected this round, not necessarily all eight;
`codev task check` fills in the rest from whichever round most recently
established or waived them, the same carry-forward it already does for a
narrow correction round. Decide the round's overall decision:
`CHANGES_REQUIRED` if any merged finding is blocking,
`BLOCKED_BY_MISSING_EVIDENCE` if any dispatched specialist could not
complete, otherwise `READY_FOR_HUMAN_APPROVAL`. Record it -- `codev task
record --id <task-id> --round <round> --role reviewer --head <head-sha>
--findings <merged-findings.json> --coverage <merged-coverage.json>
--selection <selection.json> --decision <decision>` -- `--selection` names
the specialists step 2 actually dispatched (an empty list for the
comment-sourced entry above, unless it named one) -- then run `codev task
check --id <task-id> --head <head-sha>` and act on its exit code, not your
own judgment of convergence.

## 4. Human triage

`codev task check` signals a human decision is needed here in two ways:
`ok_waiting_on_triage` (routine -- every blocking finding is either carried
from round one or explicitly tagged with `expansion_reason`), or
`stop_scope_expansion`/`stop_repeated_finding` (a blocking finding is new to
this phase, or repeats an earlier one, with no `expansion_reason` and not
yet triaged -- record the escalation first -- `codev task escalate --id
<task-id> --trigger <trigger> --cause <cause>` -- then proceed exactly the
same way). Either way, present every blocking finding to the human with one
question: which should be addressed now. For each, the human answers
`address` or `defer`; deferring a blocking finding needs a stated reason. A
triaged finding -- address or defer -- no longer counts as untriaged scope
creep or an unresolved repeat, which is how deferring resolves those two
stops. Record the answer -- `codev task triage --id <task-id> --round
<round> --triage <triage.json>` -- before doing anything else. Do not
decide this yourself, and do not treat non-blocking findings as needing a
disposition at all.

## 5. Bounded correction

After triage, `codev task check` reports one of three outcomes:

- `ok_machine_review_complete` or `ok_machine_review_complete_with_deferrals`
  -- every blocking finding was triaged as `defer`, nothing needs building.
  If this resolved a scope-expansion or repeated-finding stop, record that
  escalation now if you have not already -- `codev task escalate --id
  <task-id> --trigger human_override_blocking_finding --cause <cause,
  naming the deferred findings and where they are now tracked>` -- then go
  straight to step 6. Do not invoke `builder` for a round with nothing
  addressed.
- `ok_continue` -- at least one finding was `address`-selected: invoke
  `builder` to fix only those -- that is its full allowed scope for this
  round, stated explicitly. When it returns, invoke only the specialists
  that own the categories of the selected findings, each told to verify
  only that specific finding, not run a fresh full pass. Record coverage
  for only the dimensions actually re-verified this round -- `codev task
  check` fills in every other dimension automatically from the round that
  most recently established it, so there is nothing to re-derive by hand.
  Re-record and re-check exactly as in steps 3-4.
- `stop_round_cap` (at least one finding needs building, but this was
  already the one correction round) or `stop_incomplete_coverage` (the
  coverage manifest is incomplete even with everything else deferred) --
  record the escalation -- `codev task escalate --id <task-id> --trigger
  <trigger> --cause <cause>` -- and stop for the human with the printed
  reason. Do not attempt a second automatic correction round.

## 6. Land it

If any recording in steps 3-5 was made with `--defer-commit` (per
`.codev/for-ai/ai-agent-guidelines.md`'s bookkeeping-commits rule -- only
worth doing across a continuous stretch with no intervening human step, and
most of this skill's own steps already have one), flush it now: the next
mutating call with no `--defer-commit`, or a plain `codev git commit` if
nothing else is pending, before anything below pushes or opens a pull
request.

On `ok_machine_review_complete` or `ok_machine_review_complete_with_deferrals`,
run `codev git mark-ready --id <task-id>` -- it re-renders the task's current
evidence into the repository PR template and converts the draft out of
draft. If no pull request exists yet for this item (for example, it was
recovered into the outer phase with `codev task reopen` and never went
through the inner loop's own bridge step), run `codev slice publish --id
<task-id> --title <title>` first -- it accepts this state too, not only the
original `ok_ready_for_pr` checkpoint -- then `mark-ready`. This is not
merge authority; it only makes the PR visibly ready for the human's own
holistic review. Report the PR link, the final evidence, and any residual
risks. Never approve or merge it yourself.
